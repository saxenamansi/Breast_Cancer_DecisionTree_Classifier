# Breast_Cancer_DecisionTree_Classifier

1. Implemented Decision tree classifier for breast cancer Wisconsin dataset (load_breast_cancer) 
2. Evaluated the algorithm with precision, recall sensitivity and specificity. 
3. Visualisation of the Decision tree generated
4. Optimised the Decision Tree classifier. 
5. Evaluated the optimised Decision Tree to get better accuracy
6. Visualsed the optimised Decision Tree to see that is it way shorter than the previous one
